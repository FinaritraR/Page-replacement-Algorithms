# Page-replacement-Algorithms
FIFO and LRU page-replacement algorithms, generates a random page-reference string where page numbers range from 0 to 9. Applies the random page-reference string to each algorithm, and record the number of page faults incurred by each algorithm. Implements the replacement algorithms so that the number of page frames can vary from 1 to 7. Demand paging is used.
